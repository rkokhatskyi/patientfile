A. KB Interaction with the cards in layer 1 - right side.

B. Cardheader.vue
    1. Dx is not using CardHeader.vue 
    In Rex card -> the spanner is not coming at the right location.
    So card header component needs to be able to display the settings icon and choose columns.

    2. recs/dx card header menu should have a slide in effect.

C. When I give the command the card should come from the bottom since that is the chat interface people are used to. Currently the card comes from the top.

D. Should single tab and multi tab components be 2 different components.

E. rex needs to save data in the correct DB and table.

F. Opening a patient file without a patient should redirect to login page.

G. Cts to load for DA and D should come from DB. @raj -> what is the table name for this?

H. The sequence of Cts to load should also come from DB.
