Psychiatrist needs to be able to look at multiple historical states to make decisions and change the current state.

## Q2) Why does the left side have two tabs on the top right corner?
The 1st tab shows the health components and the 2nd tab shows the non-health components. There is a master table of components. And each component is either a health component or a "not-health" component.
