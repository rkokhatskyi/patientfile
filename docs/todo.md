1. Dx is not using tableHeader.vue 
Rex spanner is not coming at the right location.
So table header component needs to be able to display the settings icon and choose columns.

2. Should single tab and multi tab components be 2 different components.

3. rex needs to save data in the correct DB and table.

4. Opening a patient file without a patient should redirect to login page.

5. Cts to load for DA and D should come from DB. @raj -> what is the table name for this?

6. The sequence of Cts to load should also come from DB. 

7. recs/dx card header menu should have a slide in effect.
